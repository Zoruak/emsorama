First downhill PA ski boot for professionals!
Ski boot Head NEXO LYT 130
The Head NEXO LYT 130 is one of the first downhill ski boots with
a shell made from EMS polyamides. The combination of two
different Grilflex-grades with the well-known PA12 compound
Grilamid L 20A HL NZ allows a precise adjustment of the stiffness
of the ski boot shell, guaranteeing precise control over the skis.
The ratio of the individual materials in the dryblend is Head's
secret. Due to the materials used, the boots are extremely
lightweight and UV resistant. Designed and developed specifically
for professional skiers, the boots have a flex index of 130.
